# RegMan
This project is a MVC component for Joomla 2.5 to permit a remote organizing committee to access and view the inscriptions and personal information of registrants. In addition, it’s possible to edit automatically invoices based on personal information, fee and payment date.

## Installation

The installation is easy: you just have to package an installation zip file. To do so, create a compressed file of the folder “com_RegMan” and install it using the extension manager of Joomla. Then create manually 2 new tables and alter the “#__users” table as described in the file “tables.txt”. At last, edit the file “config.php” to configure the component.
You can access the webpages of the component by creating a new menu item in the menu manager of Joomla: select “Registration management“ for the field “type of link”.

Note that this project was created in 2015 to fit a specific professional need. The component was not designed to provide a universal solution.
